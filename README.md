This is a project to have generic bash script to:

1. List information of All network devices on your machine. This is good from a security standpoint to know devices connect to your system.
2. The script find the IP range that are possible on LAN.

3. iterate through the IP address range and ping the each one to see if its reachable and finally print out IP addresses that responded.

Note: this is script was tested on a ubuntu machine.
